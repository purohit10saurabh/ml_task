Check README file in Task folder to run the code.

Used behaviour cloning to imitate expert behaviour. So only recorded_images and actions are used in dataset. Images are split into random training and test split. It becomes a supervised learning problem, multi-class classification.

The code attached does following-

Save statistics of complete dataset
Create train:test split (9:1)
Train on training set
Test and evaluate accuracy on test set

Training-
Training budget was set as ~1hr. 2 V100 GPUs were used.

Following configurations of CNN were tried-

Architecture-
1. Deepmind paper (Mnih, Volodymyr, et al. "Playing atari with deep reinforcement learning.") architecture - 1.6M learnt parameters
2. LeNet-5 architecture with slight modification - 0.1M learnt parameters 

Both gave roughly same test accuracy after hyperparameter tuning. So 2nd was chosen because of less parameters.

Hyperparameters-
Adam optimizer was used.
Learning Rate - (1e-3, 0.0025, 1e-4)
Larger learning rate learns better initially but takes long to converge. Smaller learning rate of 1e-4 was best for set training budget.

Batch size - (8, 16, 32, 5000)
Compared to larger batch size, smaller batch size converge in more iterations(one iteration is training on one minibatch) but takes less time per iteration. batch size=16 gave best results.

Training time is ~1hr with 10 epochs.

Final test accuracy is 66%!!

Bonus Part-

The CNN is ported to C++. Inference and evaluation is done in C++(without opencv). It works!!!(Attached screenshot.) The output of the ported model for any given input is the same as in python. Evaluation is also done in C++, giving the same Test Accuracy of 66%.
